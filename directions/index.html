            Here&rsquo;s where you can put directions to the conference,
            and other information that will help attendees find the location,
            and find the building, and register, and find local places they can stay, etc.
            You can embed a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> iframe
            with directions to the conference like a did below.
            It can also be helpful to include maps of the campus itself,
            or pictures of the building the conference will be held in.
            I&rsquo;ve opted to use a placeholder image of a kitten below.
